## GitHub Repositories Are Being Banned ðŸš«
**The reason is the usage of certain words in repository names such as: Hack, Cheat, Hacking Tool, Game Name, Hvnc, Rat, etc.**

Furthermore, tags within repositories are also subject to restrictions. These limitations prevent the utilization of specific keywords I have positioned at the beginning of projects' tags, which are intended to enhance their discoverability.

Despite my attempts to bypass this limitation, regrettably, I did not achieve success. Consequently, I have chosen to place the source code in the Release section. Rest assured, I will include the required source code there, following the same approach as other individuals, rather than providing the executable.
